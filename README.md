# Challenge-1

## Description

First Challenge for Class - Challenge-1

I was recently hired by a marketing agency to debug the homepage of their website and bring it up to current best practices.  The goal is to clean up the backend HTML so that we are optimized for Search Engines as well as follow current accesiblity standards.

By updating the HTML and optimizing SEO we will not only make for a better user experience for users with special needs but we will also show up in more local SEO and Marketing searches.

On top of helping my new employer it also helped me to get more experience in coding/de-bugging websites which will allow me to grow in my new role.
